# TODO List for SkotOs Thin Auth Server

Following my initial work, I am leaving this server to the community. The following are my suggestions for improving it.

* Slow down polling of servers
* Add optional link to main WWW pages
* Add CE/support pages
* Make location of files generic, rather than requiring `/var/www/html/user`
* Move non-authed commands from server-auth to server-control
* Add script or instructions to rotate `/var/log/userdb.log`
